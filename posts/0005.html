        <h2>What is Merchandiser?</h2>
        <p>
            Merchandiser is an app you can download to pick up independent contractor
            1099 jobs related to merchandising, brand representation, auditing, or selling. 
            Jobs are located in local retailers like Smith's, Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven, Walgreens, 
            CVS, etc.  The list goes on and on. 
        </p>

        <h1>Referral</h1>
        <p>
            If you decide to give Merchandiser a try, do me a favor and use my referral 
            code: <strong>skylinhZQJ4</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Accepting jobs</h2>
        <p>
            In the app you can view local jobs around you on the map or list view.  They will 
            also send you special jobs for you that might include several in the same area and 
            they may offer you more money than they initially offer on the map or list view. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Accepting the job is easy.  Just click on the job and click accept. Easy peasy. 
            The app is actually done very well.  That is probably the one thing that really 
            impressed me.  The job tells you what it pays, either by the job or hourly, and 
            it gives you an estimate of how long the visit should take. 
        </p>
        <h2>Executing jobs</h2>
        <p>
            The service orders are very straight forward, it gives you step by step what 
            to do. If take a minute to read through before leaving and print out any materials
            it tells you to print, and then follow the step by step instructions, it's not too bad. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I picked up two Smith's jobs that was for auditing a cardboard POP display, and 
            if they were not displayed, I was to find it in the back and put it up. It payed
            $7 per store and an extra $5 if I had to put together the display. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing it says on the service order (on any service order with any company
            for that matter), is to find the store manager and sign into the vendor log.  A lot 
            of stores don't have a vendor log, so the first time I visit a store I'll ask if 
            they have a vendor log and I'll check in with the manager on duty, but after that 
            I'll go with whatever the store preference is if I revisit a store. Most of the time
            the store manager couldn't care less that you're there, but the manager on duty 
            might like to know what's going on especially if you are going in employee restricted 
            areas. For that reason and learning from trial and error, the first store took longer
            than the second. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The instructions told me that this display was to be in the Pharmacy area and to check
            in and coordinate with the Pharmacy Manager. I couldn't find the display, and the Pharmacy 
            Manager didn't know anything about it either.  We checked a back room where Pharmacy 
            displays are often stored and couldn't find anything, so she told me to talk to the manager 
            of the non-food side.  He didn't know anything about it either, but I checked the back 
            in the warehouse, and couldn't find anything back there either. Then they told me to talk 
            to the food manager, and she looked up the item in their inventory, and it wasn't even a product 
            that they carry. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next store, I followed some of the steps the same way, talked to the Pharmacy manager, 
            attempted to find the display in their area, and then when they referred me over to the 
            non-food manager again, I asked her to just look up the item in their inventory to see 
            if it was even a product they carried.  Again, it wasn't something in their system. 
            I was able to save a lot of time on this store by doing that.  I took the pictures
            I had to put in the service order, and I was done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of these types of comapanies have project managers that work with retailers and
            brands to make sure they are only sending people to stores that have their products 
            and avoid wasting anybody's time or money, but I'm guessing since Merchandiser is 
            an app and you can mostly self-service with the app, that they sent reps to all Smith's 
            stores regardless if they are suposed to get the display or not.  It would have been a 
            lot quicker if I had been able to go in, snap some pictures, fill out the service order, 
            and be done like I was somewhat expecting. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The next jobs I picked up were for a tabaco e-cigarette brand to check on 7-Eleven 
            locations.  They paid $12 each and were in a 1 mile radius about 20-30 minutes from 
            where I live. Basically, one store pays for gas. 
        </p>    
        <p>    
            This one I probably should have read all the way through before my first
            visit, but I just skimmed and figured most of it out as I went. I hadn't really thought
            about it, but 7-Eleven is a franchise, so the products they have in store are completely 
            upto the owner's descression.  I was expecting a typical audit, but it was actually a 
            sales pitch.  Does the store have all of the products? If not, talk to the owner or 
            whoever is in charge of ordering and give them this ellaborate sales pitch you read 
            2 seconds before talking to them to see if you can get them to order more products. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not a very good sales person. I'm great with customer service, friendly, punctual, 
            I have lots of experience with merchandising, but I am not a sales person. Especially 
            the pushy kind of sales person.  The first manager I basically said that there are more 
            products that they don't have on the shelves and if she'd be willing to order more 
            products.  To my suprise, she said yes and that she would do it later that day. Granted, 
            she may have just told me the thing she knew would keep me from talking and taking up 
            any more of her time, but I did what I was supposed to do.  I'm not earning commission, 
            and really wasn't prepared for a sales pitch so good 'nuff. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next stores were pretty similar to the first, but I figured out that the one product
            that a couple stores did carry doesn't actually work without the cartridges that 
            are sold separately, so that was a good pitch.  If you want to sell what you have, 
            order the cartridges, because it's kind of useless without them. That pitch seemed to 
            be ok.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The annoying part about the 7-Eleven jobs, is that I took the pictures they requested 
            and I took them the way the tutorial said to do them, but I got an email a couple days later 
            saying that the pictures weren't right and that I needed to send more pictures.  These stores 
            are not super close to where I live, so I'm definitely not going back. My funds weren't 
            available right away, but they did eventually pay out for these jobs even though the photos
            weren't up to their expectations. 
        </p>

        <h2>Payout</h2>
        <p>
            Merchandiser pays through Open Force, and I had some struggles! First of all Open Source's 
            website is extremely slow and terrible! I got stuck on the enrollment process because 
            my phone auto filled some information and put my first and last name in the first name
            field so when I went to submit it was failing, but when I went back to edit my name, 
            it wouldn't let me edit that part. I ended up having to email customer support and have them
            reset it so I could fix it. It took about a day for them to respond and reset it so I could
            finish the enrollment process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After enrolling, the actual payout is done on the Merchandiser app, (which is by far the 
            superior app as far as being user friendly). When you go to the Payment Center from the 
            menu, it shows your Lifetime Earnings on top then Available for Payment on the left, 
            Pending Approval on the right, and Requested Payment on the bottom. They don't use a payout
            schedule, so you have to go in and request payment to get paid, and you have to have over 
            $5 to request a payment.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I made $62.00 for less than 3 hours of work.  Overall, not too bad.  
        </p>

        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
        <p>
            If you like merchandising and brand representation type jobs, there are a lot of much 
            better alternatives. This is the only independent contract one that I know of, but there
            are some really great companies that can give you regular flexible work and pay really well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Several years ago I got let go from a company and spent some time unemployed, and out of 
            desperation I applied for this job that I figured was probably a scam because it seemed 
            too good to be true.  The pay was great! The schedule was part time, flexible, 2 days a week, one of
            those days had to be on a Saturday or Sunday, and within those guidelines, you create your own schedule.  
            As a new mom, that fit perfectly, but I thought it sounded too good to be true, so it 
            probably was. I was so lucky that it wasn't a scam and it was a great job! I loved it.  
            The employer was Marketsource and I was hired as an HP representative and worked in 
            Best Buy on the weekend and a short visit to Office Depot or Costco during the week. 
            It was incredibly easy, I learned a lot about printers and computers and I think it was a big 
            part of why I went to school for Computer Science. (Of course, computer science really isn't 
            related what so ever, but I didn't know that at the time). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked for Marketsource/HP for a couple years and I wasn't even looking for another
            job. I was happy with my job, but if an opportunity presents itself, I'm not going 
            to turn it down. While I was working a manager for another retail services company 
            came in and asked if I knew anyone who was interested in a job that was a solid 20-30 
            hours a week, create your own schedule, pays a lot more than what I was getting paid, 
            quarterly trainings where they fly you out to some location in the US put you in a hotel, 
            feed you amazing food, and talk about really cool technologies for 2-3 days. 
            Uhhh... yeah, I know someone. Me! I sent him my resume, and a few weeks later I was 
            the new Lenovo rep for Premium Retail Services. I worked in the same Best Buy store, 
            along with all of the other Best Buy locations in northern Utah, and some Costco stores. 
            This was a step up from my previous position because now I represented a whole area rather
            than just one or two stores. I had this job for 4 years and I loved it. This was without 
            a doubt my favorite job I've ever had.  The only reason I stopped was because I was gave 
            birth to my 3rd (and last) baby and was ready to be a stay at home mom. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over my time in this line of work, I met so many other reps from a lot of differnt 
            companies. Premium Retail Services, Marketsource, MarketStar, Acosta, Mosaic, Advantage 
            Solutions, Nintendo, Amazon, PepsiCo, CocaCola, SAS Retail Services, Hallmark, 
            Andersen Merchandising, Apollo Retail Specialists, and TNG Merchandising.  There are 
            probably hundreds (thousands maybe?) more. 
        </p>

        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>
            I don't think I'll be accepting jobs with Merchandiser regularly.  If I want a regular 
            flexible merchandising job, I will gain employment with a merchandising company rather 
            than doing independent contractor jobs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Merchandiser frequently has big projects, overnight 
            resets and such, that would be a good way to put in a couple days of a lot of work and 
            get paid well for it without committing to a <i>real job.</i> I will probably delete 
            the app just so I stop getting the 10 billion or so notifications and texts I get each 
            day, and maybe one day I'll download it again when I'm desperate enough. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So if you don't want to commit to a company or a <i>real job,</i> then Merchandiser 
            is a good way to make some extra money. It would not be a good full-time job, and 
            probably not a great regular part-time job either. Christmas money? Sure. Monthly 
            rent or mortgage? Probably not.
