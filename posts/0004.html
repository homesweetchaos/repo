    <h1>What have you been up to, Sky?</h1>

    <p>
    I know, I started something cool and then kind of disappeared.  First of all, I'm still doing my side-hustle experiment, but probably not as grand as I first imagined. I was in a very desperate state of mind when I started, so I probably won't be doing everything, but I will certainly be doing several.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I'm finishing up the Merchandiser app today, so I'll start my report on my experience with that one in the next couple of days and have it up by next week. Then I've had a little bit of traction on eBay, so I'll probably have some to report on that shortly after. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But let's get into what's really been taking up all my time. Somewhere in this whole process, I've had an epiphany! I don't know why I didn't consider it before.  I mean, years ago I had, but I was very overwhelmed and in a very different stage of life.  I'm so beyond stoked about this, it's all I can think about and I'm in a zoned-in-crazy-hyper-focused-ADHD-million-miles-an-hour-slightly-manic-nothing-else-exists-messy-thought-processes-wormhole state of mind.  My poor husband is probably very concerned about me if I'm being quite honest. 
    </p>

    <p>
    A little background info on me, I have an AS degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. College left me a bit overwhelmed with knowing a little bit about a lot of things and no clue where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do with it.  I was giant pregnant with my middle baby and in the growing family stage of life, so I didn't have much desire to do anything with my degree. I think I had given up all prospects of ever using my degree.  I thought I was going to have to start over because I didn't think there was anything that interested me. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So it all started when I was working on my Blog style and attempting to customize it in the free WordPress plan and I wanted to bang my head against the wall because I couldn't tweak the code.  So, I moved over to GitHub and was playing around with Templates thinking I could do it the "easy way" and just tweak a few things to my liking, but that ended up taking more time than if I were to just build the dang thing from scratch.  So, I found myself brushing up on my HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, and learning some new frameworks too.  I'm not quite finished yet (which is why I'm posting on WordPress still), but I'll migrate everything over when I do. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I have no idea what happened, but I am so into it! The last time I looked at jobs in my field (any profession in computer science), they all required a bachelor's degree and/or several years of working experience. I only have an associate's degree and no work experience so job hunting was always a bummer.  I decided to take a look anyway, and there were a lot more jobs available than there were pre-Covid, the wages have gone up, and there are jobs that just want a year of experience, no degrees required, or a portfolio to show what you can do.  I can handle freelancing for a year to get that experience.  Plus, six figures would be so nice! 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So, for the first time since I graduated, I finally know what I want to do and where to start.  I am as hyper-focused on this as it gets. So on top of my blog website, I'm also starting my portfolio website, and then I'll begin templates for small local businesses and I'll reach out to them directly to add projects to my portfolio.  BOOM! I have a plan! I'm going to make money, and be able to buy my husband pretty things (like a truck) and we'll be able to buy a house and improve our financial lives, and we'll go to Disneyland!  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Very long story short, yes, my epiphany was to use my degree! Kind of a "duh" moment really.  I'm excited that after several years that fire somehow reignited and I have the desire and motivation to actually do something in my field. Hale-freaking-lujia!
