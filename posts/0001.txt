<p>How do you make that green when your job doesn't pay?</p>

<p>I, like most moms, have a busy schedule. Between taxi driving my Kindergartner 
and 4th grader to and from school ~30 minutes across town in the morning, mid-day, 
and afternoon, entertaining my almost 3-year-old (who just barely misses the 
Pre-school cut-off), I don't have a good solid chunk of time to get a job. This 
poses a problem, because one of the reasons I sent my kids to school rather than 
homeschooling another year, was because I need to make some money. Inflation has 
hit my family hard, and the rising house prices in our area have made owning our 
own home more of a distant dream than a realistic goal. My husband has been hustling 
at his job and climbing up that corporate ladder, but even with his promotions and 
raises, we're barely keeping up with rising costs rather than getting ahead. </p>

<p>Me ready to kick ass and make some $$$ (or attempt to anyway)</p>

<p>I’m ready to kick ass and use my little downtime between shuttling kids to 
and from school, making breakfast, packing lunches, making dinner, and about 30 
snacks each day to figure out how to make some money. </p>

<p>I see side hustles all over TikTok and I always wonder which ones are the most 
lucrative.  I've even tried some and haven't had a whole lot of success, but as I 
said before, I don't exactly have an open schedule for a real job. So this begins 
my experiment. Why not try all of them? Or as many as I can anyway. I'll document 
the process on my blog (which is my first side-hustle experiment), and maybe eventually 
on YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. </p>

<p>Here is a very rough list of some side-hustles I've thought of that I could try. 
If I try them, I'll link to my results. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Blog.  Welcome! I don't know if making money will be my niche long-term, 
	maybe more of a mommy-lifestyle blog, I don't know, we'll see where things go. 
	Thanks for being here!</li>
	<li>YouTube/Instagram/TikTok influencer</li>
	<li>Affiliate Marketing (this is the main one everyone online raves about)</li>
	<li>Amazon Affiliate marketing (maybe a little more enjoyable than the previous
	since I get to promote things I love. </li>
	<li>Amazon Flex</li>
	<li>Selling print-on-demand notebooks and planners on Amazon</li>
	<li>Selling digital planners on Etsy</li>
	<li>Selling digital creations/art online (any good site recommendations?)</li>
	<li>Drop shipping/Amazon fulfilled selling </li>
	<li>YouTube channel for meditation and sleep sounds</li>
	<li>Podcast with my toddler, because toddlers are funny! </li>
	<li>Thrifting and selling locally</li>
	<li>Thrifting and selling on eBay, Amazon, or Poshmark</li>
	<li>Freelance sites - removing backgrounds from photos or proofreading 
	maybe?</li>
	<li>Selling Canva-created Instagram posts online</li>
	<li>Sell Procreate artwork for Instagram posts, digital planner stickers, 
	clip art, etc.</li>
	<li>Make and sell stickers</li>
	<li>Print-on-demand merch</li>
	<li>Create NFT's</li>
	<li>Cryptocurrency investing</li>
	<li>Stock market investing</li>
	<li>Crypto mining</li>
	<li>OnlyFans? I honestly don't know if I'd dare, but I mean a momma's 
	gotta do what a momma's gotta do, ya know? </li>
	<li>Stripping? I mean while we are already thinking about taking off my 
	clothes, maybe there is a demand for overweight mom-bods with gigantic 
	saggy tits? Private parties maybe? Yeah, I don't think I have the right 
	personality for this. Lol</li>
	<li>Sell pictures of my feet? I mean dignity has gone out the window at 
	this point. I’ll stick my feet in a tub of Mayo for a little cash.</li>
	<li>And since I’ve lost all my dignity, perhaps I could sell dirty 
	underwear? Farts in a jar? I don't know, there are a lot of weirdos out 
	there willing to pay for weird stuff. lol</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Side note: Ok so the last 3 are mostly joking… except 
			the feet one, I mean if people want to see my feet, I don’t 
			have a problem with that. They aren’t real pretty, but I’m 
			not the one getting my rocks off to it.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Uber or Lyft (not sure my car can be clean enough though.)</li>
	<li>Uber Eats, Door Dash, Grubhub</li>
	<li>Instacart</li>
	<li>Wrapify or Carvertise (use my car as a bilboard)</li>
	<li>Transcribing</li>
	<li>Audiobook reader</li>
	<li>Tutoring</li>
	<li>Flipping furniture</li>
	<li>Make and sell signs</li>
	<li>Sell all my junk (I have a lot)</li>
	<li>Merchandiser app</li>
	<li>Babysitting</li>
	<li>Surveys if there are any that aren't loop advertising scams.
	<li>Local services - cloning hard drives, addressing envelopes, data entry, 
	cutting flyers, dog walking, pet boarding, alphabetizing, setting up smart 
	home devices, anything tedious that someone might pay to have done. </li>
	<li>Biggest loser challenge or DietBet (is this more gambling than side 
	hustle though? I mean I have a lot to lose and it's something I'm working 
	on anyway, but could also lose money on it).<li>
	<li>Bartend or wait tables one night a week (I guess this is a real job, 
	but I’m not sure I can get a job with very limited availability). </li>
</ul>

<p>Not my feet... but they could be. (Wink, wink). </p>
