    Every now and then we feel ambitious and optimistic and want 
    to go have a family fun day out in the big wide world. Today that 
    was finding a place to go fishing. If you’ve ever gone fishing with 
    kids ages 3-9 you probably already know it didn’t all go according 
    to plan.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We found a nice reservoir we’ve been to a hundred times or so, 
    and got all set up with our chairs, umbrella, and sunscreened up. 
    It was an especially muddy spot and the kids immediately started 
    sinking in the mud, so they took off their shoes, and shirts, and 
    played in the mud up to their thighs and shoulders. I took a deep 
    breath and told my anxiety, “It’s ok. We will be going home muddy, 
    we’ll get cleaned up and it will be all right. It’s fun for the 
    kids.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I got up, dipped my toes in the water, and started playing with the 
    kids. Dad was off a couple hundred feet away attempting to fish 
    (I say attempting because we haven’t ever had luck catching anything). 
    He is usually on kid duty when we go fishing, so him getting to 
    fish was a big deal. We had a few minutes of perfect happy family 
    bliss. Sunshine, warmth, everyone was happy, and no one was 
    fighting or whining. I should have known it was too good to be 
    true. 😅

    Grayson is in his element.  This is literally his favorite
    thing to do.

    I noticed some green mossy stuff floating in the water, 
    “Weird, moss doesn’t usually float on the top like that.” I said. 
    I kicked some water at it and it all broke up. Hmmm… that’s not 
    normal for moss. That looks like algae. If you don’t know, you 
    aren’t supposed to play in algae water because some algae can be 
    toxic. So I sat back down and pulled out my phone to look up the 
    water conditions of the reservoir and look up if wading in it is ok.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you look at the water behind Daxton, you can see clumps of algae 
    over.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    “Uhhh… get out of the water kids. Rinse off the mud and then don’t 
    get back in.” As it turns out even wading in harmful algae can give 
    you rashes. Just as I said it, the clouds covered the sky, the wind 
    picked up, (both literally and figuratively), and that happy family 
    bliss shattered. Panic set in (my anxious 9-year-old thinks 
    everything is going to kill her). Suddenly everything hurts and 
    itches and doesn’t feel right. The kids were cold and whining, 
    everyone started fighting and just like that our few moments of 
    family bliss turned into pure unadulterated chaos. Our feet were 
    muddy and so our shoes ended up muddy; I opted to walk up the rocky 
    hill barefoot rather than ruin the nice Nikes that I spent about 5 
    times as much as the kids’ shoes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We all declared that we won’t be taking the kids fishing ever again 
    and next time we will drop them off with the grandparents and just 
    Ty and I will go fishing by ourselves. “Fine! Good! I hate going 
    fishing anyway!”, says the sassy one. So just like that, after 
    about 15 minutes at the lake, we packed up and went home. Until 
    the next time we feel optimistic and think taking the kids fishing 
    is a good idea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Sometimes I wish that the mountains weren’t my happy place. Or 
    that the rest of my family loved it as much as I do. Maybe someday
    we will have a perfect happy family outing. Until then, here is a 
    cute picture of my littlest one asleep on the drive home with mud 
    on his face, a big disgrace, kicking his can all over the place.
